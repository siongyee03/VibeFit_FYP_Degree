- **Gradle 8.3**  
- Android SDK API Level **33+**
- Internet connection
- A configured Firebase project (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Vertex AI)

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/siongyee03/FYP_Degree.git
   ```
2. **Open in Android Studio**

   Make sure to select the project root folder, not just the `/app` subfolder.
   
3. **Create your own** `google-services.json`

   Download it from your Firebase Console.
   Place it in:
   ```bash
   /app/google-services.json
   ```
5. **Create** `local.properties`

   In the project root directory, create a file named `local.properties` and add the following line (replace with your actual SDK path):
   ```ini
   sdk.dir=/path/to/your/sdk
   ```
   Example:
   ```ini
   sdk.dir=C:\\Users\\yourname\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk
   ```

7. **Create a** `gradle.properties` **file** in the root directory with the following:
   ```ini
   UNSPLASH_API_KEY=your_unsplash_key
   
   VIRTUAL_TRYON_API_KEY=your_tryon_key
   
   IMGBB_API_KEY=your_imgbb_key
   ```
   These keys are required for API calls (virtual try-on, fashion image search, image upload).

8. **Sync and Build**
   - Click **"Sync Gradle"** in Android Studio.
   - Then click **"Run"** or **Shift + F10**.
     
  
## üîë API Key Setup

To run the app properly, you will need to set up your own API keys for the following services:

### üî• Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Vertex AI, App Check)
1. Go to [https://console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Create a new project.
3. Add an Android app (package name must match your project‚Äôs package name, e.g., `com.example.vibefitapp`)
4. Download `google-services.json` from **Project Settings** and place it in the `/app/` directory.
5. In the Firebase Console, enable the following services:
   - **Authentication** ‚Üí Sign-in method ‚Üí Enable **Email/Password**
   - **Cloud Firestore** ‚Üí Create a database ‚Üí Start in test mode (for development)
   - **Storage** ‚Üí Create storage bucket ‚Üí Start in test mode
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è For production, update your Firestore and Storage security rules to restrict access.

   - **App Check**:
     - Go to **App Check** > **Your Android App** > **Manage Debug Tokens** 
     - Copy your app‚Äôs Debug Secret printed in Logcat (from `FirebaseAppCheck.getToken()`)
     - Paste it into the Firebase App Check Console to allow debug requests
   - **Enable Firebase Vertex AI (Gemini)**:
     1. Go to: [Firebase AI Logic](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/ailogic)
     2. Select your app.
     3. Click Enable Vertex AI (Gemini).
     4. Ensure your Firebase project is linked to a Google Cloud Project.
     5. In [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), enable:
        - Vertex AI API
        - Ensure billing is enabled (Google offers free tier)
    You don‚Äôt need to handle API keys for Firebase AI ‚Äî it uses built-in credentials.

### üß† Glam AI (Virtual Try-On)
1. Go to [https://glamai.com](https://glamai.com) or the official Glam AI API provider you're using.
2. Sign up or log in.
3. Get your `API_KEY` from the developer dashboard.
4. Set `VIRTUAL_TRYON_API_KEY=your_key` in `gradle.properties`.

---

### üì∑ Unsplash API (Fashion Image Search)
1. Visit [https://unsplash.com/developers](https://unsplash.com/developers)
2. Register as a developer and create a new app.
3. Copy the **Access Key** (you don‚Äôt need the Secret Key).
4. Set `UNSPLASH_API_KEY=your_key` in `gradle.properties`.

---

### üñº ImgBB API (Upload Outfit Image)
1. Go to [https://api.imgbb.com/](https://api.imgbb.com/)
2. Sign up and get your API key.
3. Set `IMGBB_API_KEY=your_key` in `gradle.properties`.
---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Firestore Indexes

Some queries in the app (e.g., sorting posts, filtering by multiple fields) may require Firestore **composite indexes**.

If you encounter an error like:

```pgsql
FAILED_PRECONDITION: The query requires an index. You can create it here: https://firebase.google.com/...
```

### üõ† How to resolve:

1. Copy the **link provided in the error message**.
2. Open it in your browser.
3. It will redirect you to the Firebase Console with the index configuration pre-filled.
4. Click **"Create Index"** and wait a few minutes for it to complete.

You can also view and manage indexes manually:
- Go to **Firebase Console** > **Firestore Database** > **Indexes** > **Composite**

Tip: During development, start with **Firestore in test mode** to avoid permission issues while configuring indexes.

## üõ°Ô∏è Admin Registration & Role Access (Hidden Entry)
To register an admin account for testing or demo purposes:

1. Open the Login Page.
2. Tap the VibeFit logo five times quickly ‚Äì this will activate a hidden admin access prompt.
3. When prompted, enter the secret admin code:
```pgsql
VIBE-ADMIN-ONLY
```
4. You‚Äôll be taken to the Admin Registration Form.
5. Enter a valid email address and create a password that meets the password policy:
   - At least 8 characters
   - Includes 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, and 1 number
6. A verification email will be sent to your address ‚Äî you must verify it before logging in.
7. After successful registration and verification, you can log in using the same login screen as normal users.

### üîë Role-Based Access Control
The app distinguishes access levels using a role field in Firestore, located at:

```bash
/users/{uid}/role
```
Possible values:
- user: Regular user (default)
- admin: Can manage posts
- superadmin: Full access, including managing admin accounts

## üìÅ Dataset Notes
All outfit and fashion images are fetched dynamically from the Unsplash API.

These images are for demonstration and testing purposes. If you use them in a deployed app or published content, make sure to follow the [Unsplash API Guidelines](https://unsplash.com/documentation#guidelines), including attribution rules if required.


## üîê Security Notes
The google-services.json and gradle.properties are excluded from version control.  

Ensure that you add your own credentials when testing or deploying the app.


## üîë Password Policy
For account security, the following Firebase Authentication password policy is enforced:

‚úÖ Enforcement Mode: Required

‚úÖ Must include:
- At least one uppercase letter (A‚ÄìZ)
- At least one lowercase letter (a‚Äìz)
- At least one numeric character (0‚Äì9)

‚úÖ Minimum length: 8 characters

If a user attempts to register or reset a password that does not meet these criteria, the system will reject the request and prompt them to use a stronger password.

üìå Where to configure it:

In **Firebase Console** > **Authentication** > **Settings** > **Password policy**, you can manually configure and enforce these rules for production deployment.
